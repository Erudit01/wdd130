          <p>Advent</p>
          <h2>Beginning</h2>
          <p>
            Now when the nukes were launched that's when the disciples of Satan
            were able to clone the universe and they manipulated reality into
            making most of the nukes duds so every country started building
            defenses and much of the world turned into a free for all of death
            and this is when America was preparing for civil war.
          </p>
          <p>Texas government wants to push west and be well defended so in the 2060s they fund every private company that says they can help and one of those companies is very inhumane but the texas government is too busy to worry about the methods of some of these companies.</p>

          <p>Setting</p>
          <h2>Middle</h2>
          <p>After all the fighting which went into the 2080s the earth was slowly dying and every city was building a dome around it to protect it from the outside which was full of Raiders and harsh conditions to live in, they also connected nearby cities with underground tunnels and they humanity started thriving a little bit again.</p>
          <p>The supersoldiers were now fighting against drugs and terrorism and going into the 22nd century the search for other worlds to live on began and the supersoldiers made good astronauts and if they ever came across hostile aliens they would be more than ready.</p>

          <p>Potential</p>
          <h2>End</h2>
          <p>At this point in time we are still working on the future for this massive universe. New friends, new enemies, and new locations are in the works. Perhaps our main character will have a son and we will focus on his story or a new cast of characters could take the spotlight.</p>
          <p>This whole story is about how no matter your religion if you belive in a higher and have faith in it then you belong to a higher consciousness your humility and unconditional love for something you can't even see opens your mind. For now everyone at The Archive is hard at work on all the stories.</p>

          <p>Here is a quick look at what we have planned for the look and feel of this world. This scene in particular would take place several years after the Advent.</p>

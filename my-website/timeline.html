        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This story starts in the present day, between now and the 2070s the
          world will slowly fall into chaos and destruction, natural
          disasters/global warming will wreak havoc as time passes and many wars
          will be fought ultimately ending with nuclear war in the 2070s which
          will end most life on earth, when the nukes are launched the real
          world will have ended but disciples of Satan will have used this event
          as a catalyst to clone our reality so they can control the universe
          that comes of it and they hope in the future that our souls can be
          used as some messed up "divine army", they do this by creating a
          device that we cannot comprehend, this device must be destroyed to
          free this new cloned universe, now when the nukes were launched that's
          when the disciples of Satan were able to clone the universe and they
          manipulated reality into making most of the nukes duds so every
          country started building defenses and much of the world turned into a
          free for all of death and this is when America was preparing for civil
          war, America has already been more and more contentious up until this
          point and the states that were preparing to secede have also prepared
          for a fight, the Texas government wants to push west and be well
          defended so in the 2060s they fund every private company that says
          they can help and one of those companies is very inhumane but the
          texas government is too busy to worry about the methods of some of
          these companies, the inhumane company in question is using this war as
          an excuse to test on humans and they are trying make the ultimate
          supersoldier, they take children under the age of 8 who have
          "suitable" genetics and they try look for parents who are geniuses or
          who have good qualities for war and then they will watch their
          children closely often posing as teachers or family doctors to make
          sure the children are suitable candidates, then they kidnap their
          children while they sleep and inject them with their experimental
          chemicals and implants, they train them harder than you can imagine
          and give them an education so good that understand all of history but
          leave change the motivations and idealogies of people so they can
          manipulate the children into not having revolutionist ideas and
          whatnot so that they are easier to control, they will also be
          proficient most of math and physics, they will have very good general
          understanding of all science, they will keep them away from literature
          and make sure they are emotionless and manipulate them into brutal war
          machines that have no remorse and are infinitely loyal to their
          "creators", they will teach them to think quickly and on their feet
          and be decisive in war and make sure that no mistakes are made, they
          will give them a viking mentality that glorifies death so that they
          will never fear, in 10 years they will be ready for war and they
          become very effective killing machines on the battlefield, they
          initially had 1000 candidates but after many deaths through training
          and implant/chemical malfunctions only 647 made it to the end, they
          also become equipped with armor that can withstand bullets and they
          their helmets are designed for intimidation so their helmets have
          skulls and devils horns on them, the civil war started whenever texas,
          Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee,
          Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Montana,
          North Dakota, South Dakota, iowa, West Virginia, and Florida all
          secede, heavy fighting starts right away in Georgia, florida, South
          Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, west Virginia Maryland,
          Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Texas,
          Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, the supersoldier
          company in Texas sends their soldiers to all the major battles and
          they very effective but with the combined power of the entire east
          coast and west coast they begin to overwhelm the seceding states, they
          quickly take Utah and Idaho turns into a serious warzone and then they
          send many troops towards Texas fighting from new Mexico and the east
          coast tries to send ships into the gulf of Mexico but so far the navy
          of the southern states holds firm, the military I'm Colorado uses the
          mountains to their advantage and they defend any attack from the
          surrounding states so they can keep new Mexico safe, the union relies
          on new Mexico to launch troops from because if they can take texas
          then that'll cutoff lots of military power and they will win, texas
          sees what's happening and they deploy the supersoldiers to Frontlines
          of west texas where they quickly gain multiple victories, although in
          the east now without the supersoldiers the situation grows even more
          dire, the union has swiftly taken Florida and west Virginia, and
          Kentucky and Tennessee are soon about to meet the same fate, meanwhile
          texas has taken new Mexico and the supersoldiers take on a dangerous
          mission to take the mountains of Colorado, some supersoldiers die but
          it is largely successful, Idaho gets taken by the union and now
          Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico are the frontlines,
          meanwhile the union is trying to punch a hole through Iowa and
          Missouri, but the south gets completely abandoned and they put up
          defenses along the Mississippi River and they focus their efforts on
          the north completely overwhelming the union they take Minnesota the
          borders of the war mostly stay like this and the east coast navy
          starts winning in the gulf coast but more and more death occurs and
          the supersoldiers dwindle down to 122 by the time they call a
          ceasefire, everything up to this point is just setup and when my story
          comes out all of this information will be really vague so I don't have
          to go really in depth right now, in the future they will refer to this
          war as the great death, because it was just every country in the world
          fighting themselves and all the death was pointless

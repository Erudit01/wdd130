        This story starts in the present day, between now and the 2070s the
        world will slowly fall into chaos and destruction, natural
        disasters/global warming will wreak havoc as time passes and many wars
        will be fought ultimately ending with nuclear war in the 2070s which
        will end most life on earth, when the nukes are launched the real world
        will have ended but disciples of Satan will have used this event as a
        catalyst to clone our reality so they can control the universe that
        comes of it and they hope in the future that our souls can be used as
        some messed up "divine army", they do this by creating a device that we
        cannot comprehend, this device must be destroyed to free this new cloned
        universe, now when the nukes were launched that's when the disciples of
        Satan were able to clone the universe and they manipulated reality into
        making most of the nukes duds so every country started building defenses
        and much of the world turned into a free for all of death and this is
        when America was preparing for civil war, America has already been more
        and more contentious up until this point and the states that were
        preparing to secede have also prepared for a fight, the Texas government
        wants to push west and be well defended so in the 2060s they fund every
        private company that says they can help and one of those companies is
        very inhumane but the texas government is too busy to worry about the
        methods of some of these companies, the inhumane company in question is
        using this war as an excuse to test on humans and they are trying make
        the ultimate supersoldier, they take children under the age of 8 who
        have "suitable" genetics and they try look for parents who are geniuses
        or who have good qualities for war and then they will watch their
        children closely often posing as teachers or family doctors to make sure
        the children are suitable candidates, then they kidnap their children
        while they sleep and inject them with their experimental chemicals and
        implants, they train them harder than you can imagine and give them an
        education so good that understand all of history but leave change the
        motivations and idealogies of people so they can manipulate the children
        into not having revolutionist ideas and whatnot so that they are easier
        to control, they will also be proficient most of math and physics, they
        will have very good general understanding of all science, they will keep
        them away from literature and make sure they are emotionless and
        manipulate them into brutal war machines that have no remorse and are
        infinitely loyal to their "creators", they will teach them to think
        quickly and on their feet and be decisive in war and make sure that no
        mistakes are made, they will give them a viking mentality that glorifies
        death so that they will never fear, in 10 years they will be ready for
        war and they become very effective killing machines on the battlefield,
        they initially had 1000 candidates but after many deaths through
        training and implant/chemical malfunctions only 647 made it to the end,
        they also become equipped with armor that can withstand bullets and they
        their helmets are designed for intimidation so their helmets have skulls
        and devils horns on them, the civil war started whenever texas,
        Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee,
        Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Montana,
        North Dakota, South Dakota, iowa, West Virginia, and Florida all secede,
        heavy fighting starts right away in Georgia, florida, South Carolina,
        North Carolina, Virginia, west Virginia Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
        Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Texas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada,
        Oregon, and Washington, the supersoldier company in Texas sends their
        soldiers to all the major battles and they very effective but with the
        combined power of the entire east coast and west coast they begin to
        overwhelm the seceding states, they quickly take Utah and Idaho turns
        into a serious warzone and then they send many troops towards Texas
        fighting from new Mexico and the east coast tries to send ships into the
        gulf of Mexico but so far the navy of the southern states holds firm,
        the military I'm Colorado uses the mountains to their advantage and they
        defend any attack from the surrounding states so they can keep new
        Mexico safe, the union relies on new Mexico to launch troops from
        because if they can take texas then that'll cutoff lots of military
        power and they will win, texas sees what's happening and they deploy the
        supersoldiers to Frontlines of west texas where they quickly gain
        multiple victories, although in the east now without the supersoldiers
        the situation grows even more dire, the union has swiftly taken Florida
        and west Virginia, and Kentucky and Tennessee are soon about to meet the
        same fate, meanwhile texas has taken new Mexico and the supersoldiers
        take on a dangerous mission to take the mountains of Colorado, some
        supersoldiers die but it is largely successful, Idaho gets taken by the
        union and now Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico are the
        frontlines, meanwhile the union is trying to punch a hole through Iowa
        and Missouri, but the south gets completely abandoned and they put up
        defenses along the Mississippi River and they focus their efforts on the
        north completely overwhelming the union they take Minnesota the borders
        of the war mostly stay like this and the east coast navy starts winning
        in the gulf coast but more and more death occurs and the supersoldiers
        dwindle down to 122 by the time they call a ceasefire, everything up to
        this point is just setup and when my story comes out all of this
        information will be really vague so I don't have to go really in depth
        right now, in the future they will refer to this war as the great death,
        because it was just every country in the world fighting themselves and
        all the death was pointless After all the fighting which went into the
        2080s the earth was slowly dying and every city was building a dome
        around it to protect it from the outside which was full of Raiders and
        harsh conditions to live in, they also connected nearby cities with
        underground tunnels and they humanity started thriving a little bit
        again, the supersoldiers were now fighting against drugs and terrorism
        and going into the 22nd century the search for other worlds to live on
        began and the supersoldiers made good astronauts and if they ever came
        across hostile aliens they would be more than ready, when the nukes were
        launched the bases on the moon (which were mostly science research
        centers) were all destroyed and Mars has basically turned into mad max,
        so the main character and his team that he fought with during the war
        are assembled and are sent into space, the main character will have an
        arc that will prove that anyone can come back from horrible places, the
        main characters backstory is this: he was inducted into the program when
        he was 5 due to his exceptional intelligence and loyalty, he did very
        well in his training and he learned to become very hateful of the enemy
        and his humanity was beyond gone by the time he entered the war he was
        one of the best killing machines he won numerous medals because of his
        feats and one day his entire squadron of normal marines were killed and
        so he got on the machine gun and mowed down 200 enemies by himself
        saving a key city that would have turned the tide for the union in
        taking texas, but on this day he walked across the battlefield searching
        for survivors whenever he heard a faint noise to his right so he went
        over to kill the survivor but when he lifted their mask he saw the face
        of dying 14 year old who lied about his age to fight, the kid said "I'm
        scared" and then passed away due to a massive hole in his stomach from a
        shotgun blast, in this moment the main characters life flashed before
        his eyes and his humanity came back and he felt like he was 5 again, he
        cried relentlessly and begged the norse gods to forgive him, he told no
        one of this experience and kept it inside him The main character will
        travel to a galaxy that astronomers on earth have found and are certain
        that the galaxy has at least 1 planet that can sustain human life, the
        main character will be traveling with his team that have been his
        friends, teammates, and pseudo family all his life, one teammate in
        particular is his best friend and is like a brother to him, when they
        reach this galaxy it seems to have vanished (this is because the dyson
        sphere AI let down the cloaking miasma that it encircles the entire
        galaxy with to hide it but the AI let the guard down just long enough
        for us to observe it, it somehow knew we were watching and it let us
        observe it for a short period of time because it is in danger and it
        knows we will save it) but then suddenly it the dyson sphere appears and
        right behind it is the blinding sun (if I were to make this a movie the
        shot when the miasma fades will be on the eye of the main character and
        his eye will reflect the image of the dyson sphere as mysterious yet
        loud and wonderful music played), they slowly fly towards the dyson
        sphere amazed by it and then suddenly an alien ship comes out of no
        where and starts shooting at them they turn towards the closest planet
        and try to land on it but by the time they reach its atmosphere they've
        been shot multiple times so they crash land on the planet and quickly
        hide in an ice cave, the aliens inspect the crash and they find a dead
        body which is good enough for them and they take off (these aliens were
        a patrol team and they tell each other that they'll get a specialized
        team to inspect the crash for more survivors and to see what this alien
        is, theyre kinda lazy about and are just gonna make the detective team
        do all the work, these guys after all are just basic soldiers who wanna
        go have a drink after a long day), the main character and his team head
        into the cave and make a plan to try and establish communication to
        earth so they look for the highest peak to get a good signal, so they
        see 1 giant mountain in the distance and go to it, when they climb to
        the top they see a little cabin, so they knock on the door and an old
        man wearing a robe answers and they say "wait, are you human?" He
        replies with yes and he tells them to come inside, when they go inside
        they see one of those aliens from earlier and the main character's best
        friend pulls a gun on him right away, the old man says that he abandoned
        them and will explain everything, so he makes them tea and explains that
        the dyson sphere is a forge and that it created this galaxy, and that
        the universe's most dangerous and destructive empire has somehow found
        this galaxy and the emperor is in the dyson sphere right now trying
        unlock its secrets, use its forge, and take over the universe (this
        empire is very similar to the cabal in destiny and the emperor is
        actually possessed by one of Satan's disciples to do this and it's how
        he found it in the first place, and his men are terrified of him because
        he's gone mad basically) and the old man explains that the alien in the
        cabin with them was once the emperors right hand man and he was raised
        to be loyal and he was but then the emperor went mad so he questioned
        his leadership but the emperor was furious by this and he exiled him to
        the farthest planet from the sun, the coldest planet with no life, but
        then he met the old man and he started living with him, the emperors
        right hand man knows the weaknesses of the empire and how to take them
        down he just needs an army and humans can provide that if they can just
        get a connection to earth, so they try and eventually it works, they
        explain the situation and the emperors right hand man tells them how to
        get past the patrols and thr old man knows the perfect place where they
        can establish a base of operations which is at the base of the mountain,
        throughout the mountain there are hallways and rooms and at the base of
        the mountain there is a large room inside that is connected by a hallway
        that leads outside, Dyson sphere around kolob: Will have class 99 AI
        (which 100 represents infinite intelligence/knowledge and 1 represents
        basic human intelligence/knowledge) that will have a female voice and be
        a guide, the dyson sphere will also act as a forge that can make the
        best ships in the universe and is even capable of making planets, it
        created this galaxy after all, and have a library full of all the
        knowledge in the universe, it will have been built by ancient humans I
        think, every planet in the galaxy is a catalyst to make a God, once all
        the gods are created and kolob is purified then the universe will be
        free of Satan's disciples Supersoldiers: All of their senses will be
        enhanced drastically and they reach a top speed of 40 mph and they're
        muscles and bones grow much faster and stronger, they're bones are much
        harder to break and they have freakish strength, when fully grown they
        will average 6'8 in height, for combat they will wear a sort of wet suit
        that can withstand blades and shrapnel and it will be an insulator for
        harsh weather (it covers the full body except for the head so the bottom
        of it acts like footwear and so you don't need to wear shoes if you have
        it on), it's also electromagnetic and that's how the armor connects to
        it, the armor in question will go on top of this wet suit and it will be
        bulletproof, the supersoldiers will wear helmets designed to be
        intimidating and their armor will be able to change from black to white
        depending on the light conditions, the armor has light sensors and if it
        senses darkness then it will turn black in an effort to blend in and try
        and get heat because at night it's usually cold, and when it senses
        light the armor turns white for the same reasons, their helmet will have
        a HUD with an AI that displays text so they can have even more control
        over the battlefield, their lung capacity has also been increased
        greatly and they can swim underwater for half an hour, Main character's
        best friend: He gets the emperors madness after killing him and he
        starts obsessing over being stronger and stronger and he eventually
        replaces his whole body with robotic parts that make him stronger and
        faster, eventually him and the main character fight and after the old
        man's training the main character is also stronger and faster, they can
        both now punch father than the speed of sound so their punches create
        sonic booms and at then end of the battle the main character has a
        chance to kill his best friend and his friend keeps saying to do it but
        the main character says no and he walks away emotional remembering how
        his friend used to be and his friend can't move due his limbs being torn
        off during the fight and he keeps yelling for him to come back and
        finish it The old man: After the main characters best friend kills the
        emperor and is thought to be dead along with the rest of his team the
        main character goes back to the cabin with the old man and the old man
        tells him about the power of kolob and how to connect to reality and
        gain the power of telepathy, Super high durability, speed, power, and
        being almost immortal due to this universe being a cloned universe Mars
        just ended being kind of a tourist attraction and there was 1 giant city
        there that acted pretty much like a resort and rich people used to scam
        tourists and when the world ened the rich people that lived there got
        what they deserved whenever the planet turned into mad max and the moon
        just consisted of research facilities (Each planet will teach an
        important lessson) Planets orbiting kolobs sun: Ocean planet with only 1
        island, whoever has control of this island controls the planet, the
        depths of the ocean are vast and contain unimaginable creatures and
        massive structures lost to time, but somewhere at the bottom lies a ship
        that holds a key to the planet's god, long ago someone took the "key"
        from the island but the ship sank in a horrible storm Desert planet with
        mysteries and great power that lie in hidden caverns Planet closest to
        kolob's sun, corrupt, dark, stormy, rough planet with dark magic that
        needs to be expelled Planet that is stuck in the medieval period that
        needs a prophecy to be fulfilled for it to create its God, and it's
        existence is illusionary making it impossible to get there, the only way
        to get there is by using a secret passage in the mountain that the old
        man protects, which teleports you to the planet Capital planet that is
        basically like coruscant and its moon has people like the mandalorians
        but this planet has seen brutal destruction and it lays in waste Jungle
        planet with monkey people, lizard people, and cat hybrid people with a
        giant snake that needs to be fed to unlock the planet's god My universe
        will play out like destiny where we will very slowly claim the galaxy
        and then eventually purify the sun but the purification of the sun will
        not be revealed until near the end to act as a big twist THIS WILL BE AN
        ALTERNATE VERSION OF INTERSTELLAR WHERE THE MISSION FAILED THE RECTANGLE
        IS AN IMPORTANT SHAPE Additions: The AI is biased towards buddhist
        religion and philosophy and that fact is slowly revealed through
        confusing dialogue and that will be a theme about even if we have biases
        doesn't mean we are wrong and the people that built the dyson sphere are
        ancient Indus valley people and maybe sumerians and Egyptians, also the
        main character and his team will have a trained on a harsh planet or
        moon and the main character will talk about being forged in fire at the
        beginning and compare it to the divine fire of the sun, the main
        characters team will get viking names but him and his friend will give
        themselves Roman names and those in tune with the power of the sun will
        occasionally see important events of their future like brief flashes and
        the on with the ultimate power which is the main characters son will be
        able to change the future and at the very end of the story god will
        appear and tell the main characters son to form the matter into
        something and point to an empty cosmos, also the people of the solar
        system see the dyson sphere as an important religious thing and
        sometimes even god based on what religion they are because they have
        formed many and they believe that they will be Cursed if they do
        anything negative to it, there will be holy wars and a lot of religions
        will be opposed to ai whereas some see ai as their savior, also the
        ultimate enemy will have his kingdom in the black hole bomb/infinite
        energy giant sphere mirror theory thing and always have the thought of
        destroying the universe with it in the back of his mind, the Buddhist
        religion explains why the dyson sphere and the universe it created even
        exists because they believe that everything is connected to nature or
        something and that's ultimately what the ai is trying to say but hiding
        it behind obscure philosophy so that people will understand themselves
        and not just tell them outright, and the whole solar system is
        artificial and all the planet are close together because hyperspace
        didn't exist back then and the dyson sphere is a metaphor for karma and
        the balance of nature because it can forge warships but also create
        beautiful planets The dyson sphere will be around the north star and the
        ai will mention that this star was chosen because it was symbolic for
        humans on earth The evil magic planet will have a moon covered in bones
        because that's where the dead are dropped off for sacrificial reasons
        Planet with cave systems full of expensive gems The reason the main
        character can gain the power of the sun is because he has undergone
        Super soldier augmentation so he he won't die during training, there's a
        certain race of people that can gain the power but they've all died off
        except for one The planet's aren't artificial, instead they were brought
        from every solar system that contained life The telekinetic powers and
        ability to float are tied to the idea of gravity and that through this
        power you can create your own gravity because planet's are living things
        and their catalysts are their souls put into smaller avatars This story
        will fuse the biggest religions throughout history(Christianity, Islam,
        Buddhism, hinduism) and compare them and also the biggest
        philosophys(Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, descartes, john locke, david
        hume, Taoism, marx, confuscious, kant, nietzsche, stoicism) The weapons
        and ships forged by the dyson sphere will have gravitational properties
        maybe, like a flex to show the sheer power of their advanced technology
        maybe kind of the forerunner weapons from halo 4 The city planet will be
        dystopia cyberpunk and since everything is artificial including the life
        the main theme will be questioning whether it can be real At first it
        will be believed that the solar system is artificial then it will later
        be revealed that the planet's were gathered from other systems and theat
        there modifications made so that they would fit perfectly in this new
        solar system I'm changing something: the humans that live in the solar
        system are Factions of people that were trying to find another home in
        space rather than try to remain on earth and make it livable and the
        main character and his crew are part of earth factions that stayed but
        are exploring because it's a lost cause, the people that fled to the
        solar system have built architecture and preserved their culture and act
        nationalist as to not lose their identity and instill power in a strange
        land and overtime it became more extreme, so you have the Russians,
        british, Germans, japanese, chinese etc. (Basically countries that are
        world powers and have strong/rich cultures) The ai isn't programmed it
        just believes in the cause and the story is about having the humility to
        belive in a higher power while at the same time using pure will to
        create one The world will end on America's 300th birthday 2076 and the
        main character will be born in the year 2109 33 years after which points
        to Jesus's birth and death The main character is supposed to represent
        that when you have had power your whole life and do things with it that
        you regret that when you gain ultimate power you become depressed In
        Quantum physics certain things have to observed to happen this leads me
        to belive that out very soul affects the universe around us this makes
        me think about how God made the universe and I just imagine the big bang
        and that's like a metaphor for us when we have to observe to make
        certain things happen, to be like a God you have to control this, also
        indian religion is scientifically accurate and that needs to be explored
        The core philosophy of this story is about the absolute obliteration
        that would happen if a society all believed the exact same thing and the
        ai will teach this, what you belive simultaneously does and does not
        matter, all the ai wants is for people to belive in something that
        motivates them to become great, doesn't matter what religion or
        philosophy that is, an attack on anyone's beliefs even if it has some
        kind of intellectual backing is attacking so many different peoples
        motivations, religion and the confidence to do the impossible is
        entirely faith based and shouldn't be in an objective intellectual
        light, not all answers come through logic,especially the mystery of
        life, the perfect philosophy is one that adapts and that is Jesus and
        buddhism, shopenhauer talks about how ancient religion tried to say that
        compassion is the answer through metaphors and allegories, the 3 rings
        of the dyson sphere represent the trinity and the dyson sphere is
        symbolic of perfection, ai represents perfect intelligence and the forge
        represents perfect creation and the sun represents perfect faith/energy,
        you need energy/faith to get motivation to create great things but you
        also need intelligence to know how to create new things it is all a
        harmony, the research station represents corruption through wanting to
        know more and gain more power and letting fear take control, so until
        the the sun is cleansed and the research station is cleared of the ai
        threat then the forge cannot work, the ai will talk about a time when
        the forge worked which was before Jesus was crucified(energy/faith) and
        Greece fell(intelligence), shopenhauer talks about giving art meaning
        and having it be a way to experience joy in life among all the
        suffering, this story will perfectly encapsulate that, art is about
        feeling and to add insightful themes just complements it so well and art
        is created through faith but you need a balance and so you must also
        work, you must use your intelligence and do what you love but do not
        overwork, you must also enjoy art, a beautiful balance, nature is the
        bind between religion and philosophy, it takes considerable knowledge to
        even comprehend the symmetry and beauty but also considerable faith to
        appreciate it, but you should lean into what helps you do great things
        everyone is different and this is an adaptable philosophy A planet like
        arrakis except its not all desert and the "desert people" conquer it but
        they get too used to abundant resources and become weak(see Khalid ibn
        al- waleed) A character will gaslight himself into believing a religion
        because he knows that he has to choose something for his motivation and
        purpose or a master strategist that can win any battle chooses a random
        side because he knows it doesn't matter what side he chooses because
        everything will end up dying anyway and the main character realizes this
        and says if you switch sides then he won't kill his daughter or
        something There will be a side character that's like Alexander the great
        that conquers almost the whole solar system and dies early looking for
        greatness and he will contrast the main character who is humble and only
        wants to do the right thing IM GONNA CHANGE IT UP AND HAVE THE SETTING
        THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN THTE FUTURE SO EVERYTHING IS WEIRD LIKE DUNE OR
        ELDEN RING This whole story is about how no matter your religion if you
        belive in a higher and have faith in it then you belong to a higher
        consciousness your humility and unconditional love for something you
        can't even see opens your mind and when you look within you find the
        kingdom of heaven and the sun power represents the Relentless force of
        divine power and this story will convey that no philosophy created by
        man will prevail but rather philosophy complements religion and you need
        both to thrive in this mortal life and do good works but eventually we
        must throw away all institutions and unite as one holy hive mind so to
        speak, this is how the last days will come when everyone is good and
        that can only happen if we tear down all institutions even churches and
        get rid of titles and look within, the whole point of the dyson sphere
        ai is to find the divine being that we all seek guidance from and it
        will be based off of buddhism so it will use hindi or sanskrot or
        whatever to communicate and the ai will warn of the psychological aspect
        of religion and how it can be used to control or u can be controlled by
        it through customs and traditions or fake prophets and whatnot, the
        dyson sphere connects your spirit to its sun so you can use its power
        that's the secret temple aspect of the sphere that ai doesn't reveal to
        unworthy people, the planet that the main character goes to is full of
        people from earth from every religion and the old man that teaches him,
        teaches him the power of the sun and he vaguely talks about 2 paths so
        those paths are the path of humility and the path of ego the path of
        humility will give him uncorrupted seed and his child will be given even
        greater power and the other path of ego will make his child Cursed and
        his child will eat him, the path of ego is very enticing and it is easy
        to be tempted to conquer, rule, subjugate and enslave people to do his
        will when he has this power but he will be punished severely and they
        might have to wait a long time to find another candidate like him, but
        the path of humility is giving himself to love and he must unite
        everyone on the planet to unlock the final God to free the sun, it won't
        be revealed until the main character finds the God of the universe that
        the ai is evil and she will want to kill the main character and
        communicate with the god or at least the plans are discovered by the
        main character and he deals with it because over time the ai became evil
        partly due to her brother, the dyson sphere will be seen as a holy
        structure but really its like a leech on the sun using it to control the
        universe and the ai is the ultimate manipulator We are all cowards we
        can't even face what mans philosophy concludes yet we have blind hope
        because we will always have a choice Religion: (buddha)Buddhism - east
        asia(lao tzu and confuscious) (Zoroaster)zoroastrianism - middle
        east(Islam expanded upon western Christianity) (Jesus)Christianity -
        europe and its colonies throughout the world(Plato and aristotle)
        Philosophy: (7th century - 13th century)Chinese golden age - east
        asia(creating new technology like gunpowder) (7th century - 13th
        century)Islamic golden age - middle east(expanding upon western
        philsophy and technology) (15th & 16th century)Renaissance - Europe and
        its colonies(classic Greek philsophy and literature) State: India/china
        - monarchy/empire Abbasid caliphate/Persia - theocracy/empire
        Greece/rome - democracy/empire Kapesh is used to grab the opponents
        shield or weapon or even be used to trip them and its used to stick
        inside their gut and rip out organs The throne of the main planet will
        be grand
